# trellis-synth32

I got an Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 and I've spent a while hacking on it to make self-contained synthesizer. Features:

- Each button on the trellis is individually voiced so you can mash as many keys as you want.
- Up to 4 layers (currently) for selecting different note sounds.
- A configurable filter stack with bitcruncher, feedback/distortion and more.
- Live configuration of that filter stack with a modular setting system.
- An interactive menu system that controls the above using two rotary encoders and an oled display.
- Configurable (in code) presets.
